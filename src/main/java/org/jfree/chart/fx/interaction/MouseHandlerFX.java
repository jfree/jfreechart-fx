/**
 * The interface for a mouse handler, which is an object that listens for
 * mouse events on a {@link ChartCanvas} and performs a function in response
 * to those events (typical functions include tooltip display, drag zooming,
 * mouse wheel zooming and panning).  A handler can be registered with the
 * {@link ChartCanvas} as a regular handler or as an auxiliary handler.  Upon a 
 * mouse pressed event, the canvas will select *one* regular handler to be the
 * current "live" handler - this selection normally takes into account the
 * modifier keys that are specified for the handler.  The live handler is
 * responsible for unregistering itself once it has finished handling mouse
 * events (it can be reselected again on subsequent mouse pressed events).
 * The auxiliary handlers are always called to respond to mouse events, but
 * after the live handler has dealt with the event first.  Auxiliary handlers
 * should not perform tasks that could interfere with the live handler.
